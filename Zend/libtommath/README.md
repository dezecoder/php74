This directory contains a copy of [LibTomMath](http://www.libtom.org/), a Public Domain/WTFPL arbitray-precision integer arithmetic library used to implement the `IS_BIGINT` type by default (GNU Multiple Precision can also be used, but is not included).

The files `LICENSE` and `tommath.h` are taken unmodified from LibTomMath, while `mpi.c` is the C file generated by the file `gen.pl` in the full LibTomMath distribution.

This currently contains a generated `mpi.c` and a verbatim `LICENSE` and `tommath.h` from LibTomMath v0.42.0.
